#### An application to tell you where I am and where I plan to be. And what Ive been working on!
## Best tools for finding my location:<br>(these are the application api's I will interact with)
Present:
1) trolling my bank statement to resolve location. They have no access other than location information. 
Keyword search only gathers info on specific blips "starbucks" "tiajuana flats"
2) Foursquare sometimes tells you some stuff.

Future:
1) Meetup.com, FacebookEVents, Eventbrite, **Put more stuff here** 
2)



going to this ticket master live nation eventbrite 
buy something or rsbp ... currently does... do you want to share with friends.
facebook twitter is anyone sharing things at location.

Infinate possibilities:

In the beginning it was a few good friends. 
But then there were some falling out's.
Drama.
You became mainstream.
acquaintances started coming. 
The party became stail. 
Or maybe you just need a recount.

the app works by creating a single link for people to find you.
The link persists. Unless you become fed up.
Then at the press of a button,
b it up and get a new link!
A new way to control access to who is viewing you. 

your Possy needs to request via text message.
So you b up the link 
and your friends b up your phone

B everywhere
b away

B ahoy
